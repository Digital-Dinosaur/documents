## Infinite Landscape

An ever-expanding, user-created exploration space.

### What does this solve?

There are many online games and forums for creating and sharing adventures but none allow you to visualize and spontaneously dive into another person's imagination. In Infinite Landscape, you can explore a map of user-generated places and stories. Highlighted items of interest will give personality and detail to each location. The short-form narratives will be easy to create and easy to use for inspiration and entertainment.

### Key Features
 
* Consists of a front-end, RESTful+CRUDful API, database (undecided between NoSQL or SQL)
* Users add locations to a map, writing a description of a landscape of their imagination
* Users can explore these user-generated locations and navigate between them
* Users can also view a simple map of the locations
